-- =====================================================================
-- ACREDIA-STELLAR — TRIAGE SELF-SIGNUP ACCOUNTS (IDEMPOTENT)
-- Issue #239: Remove public self-signup; move to closed provisioning
-- =====================================================================
-- What this file does:
--   1. Records a provisioning origin on `public.institutions`, so a
--      self-registered row is distinguishable from a provisioned one.
--   2. Triages existing institutions: rows that no admin ever provisioned are
--      SUSPENDED, never deleted, with the decision and its basis recorded.
--   3. Closes the self-insert paths that public signup depended on, including
--      the signup mirror triggers that created rows from auth metadata.
--
-- Suspension is deliberately reversible: an institution that turns out to be
-- legitimate is reinstated by an admin setting status back to 'pending', with
-- the audit row below explaining why it was suspended in the first place.
-- =====================================================================

-- the service role and insert explicitly.
